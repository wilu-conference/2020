<p>The WILU Planning Team is dedicated to providing a positive event experience for all participants, and expects host institutions, volunteers, attendees, and speakers to show respect and courtesy toward one another at all conference events. We value ideas, thoughts, and expression, and we appreciate new pedagogy when delivering workshops and sessions. Discriminatory language and imagery are not appropriate for any WILU event venue, keynotes, workshops, or sessions.</p>
<h2>Conduct During the Conference</h2>
<p>The WILU Planning Team does not tolerate harassment in any form. Harassment is understood as any behaviour that threatens another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment. It includes (but is not limited to) offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religious beliefs, sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces (including online), deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Please remember that harassment is subjectively experienced, and that it is not the intention behind the action that matters but the impact of the action.</p>
<h2>Bystander Intervention</h2>
<p>In the unfortunate event that WILU 2023 participants witness any racist, sexist, ableist or other discriminatory behaviour, we ask that they consider their role as bystanders and feel empowered to respond in a way that positively influences the outcome. If at any time a participant feels that they have been harassed or that this code of conduct has been breached, it is important that the participant report the incident to a member of the WILU Planning Team.</p>
<h2>Mindful Social Media</h2>
<p>The WILU Planning Team asks that all participants be mindful of their social media use while at WILU 2023. If you are planning on taking photos, screen captures, or videos while at WILU 2023, please ask permission of attendees and session presenters before posting or tagging photos that may be identifying or contain potentially sensitive information.</p>
