            <p>Over the past few weeks, we have been closely monitoring the health situation to better assess the feasibility of hosting WILU in-person. Unfortunately, with the continued uncertainty of Covid, the steering committee has made the difficult decision to postpone WILU until 2023.</p>
            <p>We are very sorry that we’ve had to make this decision. As a group, we talked about infection rates in Montreal, changing travel restrictions, logistics, and personal comfort. We realized that even in the unlikely event that the situation adequately stabilizes before March, we would not have enough time to plan the conference we would like to host. For those that voted in our Twitter poll, thank you for your input; it certainly weighed in our decision.</p>
            <p>We know how many of you were looking forward to coming to Montreal. And we were looking forward to hosting you and showing you our beautiful city. We also know that a great sense of community and fun develops during WILU with the dine-arounds, social activities, and hanging out during lunch. And it’s for these reasons that we’ve been committed to hosting an in-person conference, and not moving online. We want to share that with you!</p>
            <p>For those of you who have submitted proposals, thank you! We will be in touch with you directly to discuss next steps but rest assured they will be considered for 2023. We will re-open our call for proposals in October 2022 for those who weren’t able to submit for this round.</p>
            <p>We appreciate your understanding and cannot wait to see you all next year for WILU Carte blanche!</p>
