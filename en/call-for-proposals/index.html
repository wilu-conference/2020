<h2>Conference theme – Carte Blanche</h2>
<p>As information professionals, our roles continue to change as the definition of information literacy grows to include a diverse range of skills. We thrive in an environment that promotes and values innovation and experimentation. To respond to the evolving needs of users, we must embrace spontaneity and risk-taking. Librarians are often described as intellectually agile, with the ability to adapt quickly to new technologies or philosophies. How do we adjust traditional teaching practices to reach our users? How do we decide which topics and teaching styles to use? We invite proposals that consider what it means to have “carte blanche” to design and deliver timely, relevant library instruction sessions with the freedom to try new things, experiment with novel ideas, and start fresh.</p>
