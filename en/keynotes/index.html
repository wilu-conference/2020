<p>Since 2018, Dr. Alex Ketchum has been the Faculty Lecturer of the Institute for Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies of McGill University. She is the Director of the Just Feminist Tech and Scholarship Lab and the organizer of Disrupting Disruptions: The Feminist and Accessible Publishing, Communications, and Tech Speaker and Workshop Series. Her work integrates food, environmental, technological, and gender history. Ketchum’s first peer-reviewed book, <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/press/engage.html"><em>Engage in Public Scholarship!: A Guidebook on Feminist and Accessible Communication</em></a> (Concordia University Press, 2022), examines the power dynamics that impact who gets to create certain kinds of academic work and for whom these outputs are accessible. Coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of the trailblazing restaurant Mother Courage of New York City, Ketchum’s second book, <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/press/ingredients.html"><em>Ingredients for Revolution: A History of American Feminist Restaurants, Cafes, and Coffeehouses</em></a> (2022), is the first history of the more than 230 feminist and lesbian-feminist restaurants, cafés, and coffeehouses that existed in the United States from 1972 to the present. Ketchum’s interest in past imaginings of utopia through business creation and the implementation of communications technologies has guided her new research and third book project on historically contextualizing the relationship between feminist ethics and AI.
