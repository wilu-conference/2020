<a name="bohan"></a>**Dr. Margie Clow Bohan**
Writing, teaching, and compiling information are three of Margie’s passions. Educated at St. F.X. (BA English), Carleton (MA English), Mount Allison (BEd), and Dalhousie (PhD Writing & Organizational Studies), she is most enthusiastic discussing strategies for effective communication. Most of her career has been spent teaching business writing in university classes and managing the Dalhousie Writing Centre. In addition, she has focused her research on writing in teams, interdisciplinary/professional writing challenges, leadership competencies, and introduction of university writing genres to both undergraduates and graduate students. One research project that the group may be interested in is one that looked at how university librarians and writing advisers collaboratively support student learning. Margie offers insight and tips on writing professional dossiers. *([Workshop description](/program/workshops#workshop-1).)*
