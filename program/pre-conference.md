### Getting Started with the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning: A Workshop to Discover What is Possible ###

<!-- One of the best ways to inform teaching and learning is by asking questions, and the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) helps instructors do just that. SoTL is a movement in higher education to study teaching and learning in order to improve both. SoTL continues to grow internationally and has recently gained momentum in librarianship. As librarians and information literacy professionals, there is much we can learn from engaging with SoTL. We also have much to contribute. 

<!-- The goals of this pre-conference are for attendees to: 
.Determine why SoTL is a good fit for the study of information literacy, 
.Identify what they can do with SoTL, 
.Decide how they wish to engage with SoTL, 
.Brainstorm SoTL questions, 
.Create an action plan for a SoTL project.  -->

<!-- Through active learning exercises, attendees will use a project planning toolkit to create an action plan for a SoTL project. Workshop attendees will engage in discussions that focus on their local teaching context and how that context impacts the SoTL work they wish to do. With a focus on asking good questions, attendees will consider teaching and learning phenomena they are curious about and what SoTL questions they want to ask to help them gain insight into their own teaching and their students’ learning. Attendees will also identify potential collaborators, brainstorm ideas for a research design, and determine how best to engage with SoTL. Attendees will leave the session with concrete ideas for moving forward with their own SoTL project.  -->
