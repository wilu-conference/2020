### Teaching as though what mattered most was our learning ###

<!-- In this session, Kim Brooks takes on the hard question of what the university would look like if what we cared about most was learning:  our own and our students’.  Most of us are so pressed by the daily demands of our jobs – real or perceived – that we forget what motivated us to work in a university setting.  The session will be divided into four parts: (1) what we wish we knew; (2) what our students wish we knew; (3) we what wish our students knew; and (4) who we plan to be, perhaps not in that order! -->

Kim Brooks is the Purdy Crawford Chair in Business Law, a teacher at Dalhousie’s Schulich School of Law, a 3M Fellow, and a sometimes student.
